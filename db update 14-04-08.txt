IMPORTANT DB UPDATE 14/04/2008

ATTENTION: This script changes the database structure and many  values. Consider backing up the database before.

Copy db_update_140408.php to the main PHP-Fusion folder

Access the file in your browser. the script will optimize the database layout and calculate the values of some new fields.
On large forum databases, the script could hit the maximum execution time. To avoid this, the script will stop and reload
after 20 seconds and should continue updating th values. This process will be repeated until all threads and forums are
updated.
The output should look like this (the number of ... is corresponding to the size of the database):

Updating DB structure ...done
