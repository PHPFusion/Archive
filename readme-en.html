<div class='tbl2'>INTRODUCTION</div>

<div class='tbl1'>PHP-Fusion is a
light-weight open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP 5 (compatible with PHP 4).
It utilises a MySQL database to store your site content and includes a simple, comprehensive
administration system. PHP-Fusion includes the most common features you would expect to see in many
other CMS packages.

</div>

<div class='tbl2'>INSTALLATION</div>

<div class='tbl1'>Before installing PHP-Fusion you need to create a MySQL database. You
can do this via your web-hosting control panel or phpMyAdmin. Make sure you have your
mysql access details at hand including the hostname, username, password and database
name as you will need to specify these during setup.

<p><b>1.</b> Before you upload the files, rename the file _config.php (located
in the folder entitled files) to config.php.

<p><b>2.</b> Upload the contents of the files folder to your web server.

<p><b>3.</b> Unless you are running PHP-Fusion on a local server, in most cases you
will need to CHMOD the following files and folders to 777:

<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
<li>administration/db_backups/</li>
<li>images/</li>
<li>images/imagelist.js</li>
<li>images/articles/</li>
<li>images/avatars/</li>
<li>images/news/</li>
<li>images/news_cats/</li>
<li>images/photoalbum/</li>
<li>images/photoalbum/submissions/</li>
<li>forum/attachments/</li>
<li>config.php</li>
</ul>

<p><b>4.</b> Go to your website where setup.php should start automatically. If not, you
should run setup.php manually by entering your full site url followed by
/setup.php. Example: http://www.yourdomain.com/setup.php.

<p><b>5.</b> Complete the setup process by following all on-screen prompts.

<p><b>6.</b> Immediately after completing the installation of PHP-Fusion you must
CHMOD config.php back to 644 AND delete setup.php from your web server.</div>

<div class='tbl2'>UPGRADE FROM V6.01.12+</div>

<div class='tbl1'>Before you upgrade we strongly recommend that you backup your
files and your database as PHP-Fusion 7 is a major update compared to its
predecessors. You need to follow these instructions precisely.

<p><b>1.</b> Version 6 code is not directly compatible with version 7. You must
either update any mods, infusions, panels or themes before upgrading OR acquire
a version 7 compatible update. It is recommended, however, that you disable all
3rd party code to avoid any problems.

<p><b>2.</b> First you must upload the upgrade script from the folder
named 'upgrade v601x' to the administration folder of your site.

<p><b>3.</b> Login to your site as the Super Administrator. Under the System
Admin tab of the Admin Panel, click on Upgrade then click the button marked
Upgrade. YOU MUST follow the upgrade through a number of steps, the upgrade
process will complete only when you see 'Database upgrade complete'.

<p><b>4.</b> VERY IMPORTANT: Since this release contains a number of structural
changes, some elements of your site will not work properly until you have
updated all of your files. YOU MUST upload ALL of the files from the files
folder.

<p>If at all you are any doubt please feel free to ask one of our support
sites for help, there are plenty of knowledgeable users in our community
who can help or advise you regarding the upgrade process.</div>

<div class='tbl2'>SECURITY TIPS</div>

<div class='tbl1'>Here are some useful tips to help keep your site secure:
<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
<li>Ensure config.php is not writable (should be CHMODed to 644).</li>
<li>Never leave setup.php on your server once PHP-Fusion is installed.</li>
<li>Always ensure your FTP and MySQL passwords are different.</li>
<li>Never allow forum attachments such as php, html, exe, or any type of text file.</li>
</ul></div>
