<div class='tbl2'>INTRODUCTION</div>

<div class='tbl1'>PHP-Fusion is a
light-weight open-source content management system (CMS) written in PHP 5.
It utilises a MySQL database to store your site content and includes a simple, comprehensive
administration system. PHP-Fusion includes the most common features you would expect to see in many
other CMS packages.

</div>

<div class='tbl2'>INSTALLATION</div>

<div class='tbl1'>Before installing PHP-Fusion you need to check the requirements for this version:
<p>- PHP5<br />
- MySQL 4
<p>You have to create a MySQL database. You can do this via your web-hosting control panel or phpMyAdmin.
Make sure you have your mysql access details at hand including the hostname, username, password and database
name as you will need to specify these during setup.

<p><strong>1.</strong> Before you upload the files, rename the file _config.php (located
in the files folder) to config.php.

<p><strong>2.</strong> Upload the contents of the files folder to your web server.

<p><strong>3.</strong> Unless you run PHP-Fusion on a local server, in most cases you
will need to CHMOD the following files and folders to 777:

<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
<li>administration/db_backups/</li>
<li>downloads/</li>
<li>downloads/images/</li>
<li>downloads/submissions/</li>
<li>downloads/submissions/images/</li>
<li>forum/attachments/</li>
<li>ftp_upload/</li>
<li>images/</li>
<li>images/imagelist.js</li>
<li>images/articles/</li>
<li>images/avatars/</li>
<li>images/news/</li>
<li>images/news/thumbs/</li>
<li>images/news_cats/</li>
<li>images/photoalbum/</li>
<li>images/photoalbum/submissions/</li>
<li>config.php</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some hosts doesn't allow CHMOD 777, in that case you can use CHMOD 755 if CHMOD 777 fails.

<p><strong>4.</strong> Go to your website where setup.php should start automatically. If not, you
should run setup.php manually by entering your full site url followed by
/setup.php. Example: http://www.yourdomain.com/setup.php.

<p><strong>5.</strong> Complete the setup process by following all on-screen prompts.

<p><strong>6.</strong> Immediately after completing the installation of PHP-Fusion you
<b>must</b> CHMOD config.php back to 644 AND delete setup.php from your web server.
Failure to do so could lead to someone else taking control of your site.</div>

<div class='tbl2'>UPGRADE FROM V7.00.XX OR V7.01.XX</div>

<div class='tbl1'>Before you upgrade we strongly recommend that you backup your
files and your database as PHP-Fusion 7.02 is a major update from PHP-Fusion 7.01.
You need to follow these instructions precisely.
We also recommend that you do the upgrade from 7.00.xx to 7.01.xx first before you upgrade to 7.02.00.

<p><strong>1.</strong> Version 7.02 code is mostly compatible with version 7.01, however since
there are a lot of changes to the core, some addons (mods, infusions, panels or themes) may
not work properly.

<p><strong>2.</strong> You must first upload the upgrade script from the folder
named 'upgrade v7' (or 'upgrade v701' if you already have v7.01 running)
to the administration folder of your site and upload the folder named
'locale' to the root of your site. Without the locale files, some names may not be added
to the database.

<p><strong>3.</strong> Login to your site as the Super Administrator. Under the System
Admin tab of the Admin Panel, click on Upgrade then click the button marked
Upgrade. YOU MUST perform the upgrade first! The upgrade
process will complete only when you see 'Database upgrade complete'.

<p><strong>4.</strong> VERY IMPORTANT: Since this release contains a number of structural
changes, some elements of your site will not work properly until you have
updated all of your files. YOU MUST upload ALL of the files from the /files-folder, EXCEPT:

<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
<li>_config.php</li>
<li>setup.php</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5.</strong> VERY IMPORTANT: Add the following line to your config.php and replace XXXXX with different chars
or numbers and use a different prefix for every PHP-Fusion installation!<br /><br />
define("COOKIE_PREFIX", "fusion_XXXXX");

CHMOD the following files and folders to 777:
<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
<li>downloads/</li>
<li>downloads/images/</li>
<li>downloads/submissions/</li>
<li>downloads/submissions/images/</li>
<li>ftp_upload/</li>
</ul>

<p>If at all you are any doubt please feel free to ask one of our support
sites for help, there are plenty of knowledgeable users in our community
who can help or advise you regarding the upgrade process.</div>

<div class='tbl2'>SECURITY TIPS</div>

<div class='tbl1'>Here are some useful tips to help keep your site secure:
<ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
<li>Ensure config.php is not writable (should be CHMODed to 644).</li>
<li>Never leave setup.php on your server once PHP-Fusion is installed.</li>
<li>Always ensure your FTP and MySQL passwords are different.</li>
<li>Never allow forum attachments such as php, html, exe, or any type of text file.</li>
<li>Only use addons that have been tested and approved as safe.</li>
</ul></div>
