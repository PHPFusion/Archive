As some of you may have noticed a brief moment of downtime, don't worry, everything is still intact. I am currently working on improving various bits of Power-Portal, whilst at the same time planning the release of MyCMS v1.3. The latest release will add Private Messages and Members List (as seen here).

As I said earlier this month, I am committed to continuously improving MyCMS at a steady pace. Power-Portal is my own personal version of MyCMS and will not be made publicly available. It's not a major issue however, since MyCMS will probably have most if not all of the features of Power-Portal integrated at some point.

One final note:
